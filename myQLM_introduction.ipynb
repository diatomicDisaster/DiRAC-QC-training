It also allows us to embed floating point data much like the angle embedding scheme.\n","\n","In a way, amplitude encoding is the holy grail of quantum embedding. The problem is that in practice, realising the circuit that applies $S_x$ is very challenging and generally requires a large number of gates, increasing the circuit depth and computational complexity.
